# MAE301-Project
MAE 301 Preliminary Project Report 

	I will be testing the influence of percent infill on the strength of a cylindrical extruded part of height 3.5cm and diameter of 8cm represent a scaled down version of a short, hollow musical drum. The drum topography and filament will remain the same throughout each test. The drum will have a smooth topography and the filament will be PLA as it is the most highly used filament type in the Fulton 3D Print Lab and will make testing a simpler process. 
	I will test the compressive strength of this design in SOLIDWORKS and then  approximate the computer model with the use of either a pulley system to lower a weight onto the 3D printed part, my hands, or one of the MAE 322 testing machines (with faculty approval). 
	I hypothesize that the difference in distribution means for 10 and 20 percent infill will be ten times that of the difference in distribution means for 40 and 50% infill. The structure strength will increase exponentially with increase in percent infill until, at an unknown point before 50%, the structure strength tends to a horizontal asymptote. (10% is much stronger than 5%, but 70% and 100% are practically idential in structure strength in compression.)
	I will be testing 5,10, 40 and 50% infills. 
	This test will be in an attempt to find the point at which
