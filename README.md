# MAE301-Project
MAE 301 Preliminary Project Report 

	I will be testing the influence of percent infill on the strength of a cylindrical extruded part of height 1.75cm and diameter of 4cm to represent a scaled down version of a short, hollow musical drum with a diameter of 16in and a height of 7in (model will be 1/10 the size of the origional). This test will be used to determine the point at which additional internal drum supports will become redundant. In this case, redundant refers to ratio of change in fracture strength over change in weight. The drum model will represent a multisensory drum to be used with children. As a result, this drum can include internal structures - as the sounds will be produced electronically - and it needs to be both strong and light. Testing will be confined to the midrange of infill - 30% - 60% - as this area should (logically) contain the point at which structures begin being redundant.
	The drum topography and filament will remain the same throughout each test. The drum will have a smooth topography and the filament will be PLA as it is the most highly used filament type in the Fulton 3D Print Lab, will make testing a simpler process, and can be recycled at the conclusion of this test. 
	I will test the compressive strength of this design in SOLIDWORKS and then approximate the computer model with the use of either a pulley system to lower a weight onto the 3D printed part, my hands, or one of the MAE 322 testing machines (with faculty approval). Each test will be preformed with the same, currently undetermined amount of force. 
	I hypothesize that the difference in distribution means of fracture strength for 30 and 40 percent infill will be five times that of the difference in distribution means for fracture strength of 50 and 60% infill. The structure strength will increase exponentially with increase in percent infill until, at an unknown point near 50%, the structure strength tends to a horizontal asymptote. (10% is much stronger than 5%, but 70% and 100% are practically idential in structure strength in compression.)
	I will be testing 30,40,50 and 60% infills. These structures will be printed using the MakerBot Replicator printer at the Fulton 3D Print Lab. 
	I assume the variation in fracture strength does not change with percent infill. I assume that the standard deviation of each distribution is a real number which will be approximated by the sample standard deviation for all samples as each sample is the same structure design and filament type.
  
	The data on the following website will be used for reference in determining the amount of force to be applied to the samples. http://2015.igem.org/wiki/images/2/24/CamJIC-Specs-Strength.pdf
