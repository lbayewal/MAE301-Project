Upon attempting compression testing utilzing an instron tensile testing device, the origional model dimensions were found to be too strong to test in compression. The model was decreased to a fourth of the size for a repeat of the intially planned testing procedure, of applying an axial load in compression until fracture (recognized by the sound of failure in 3D filamnent). Specimens of one quarter the origional size of the model with 30,40,50, and 60% infill will be compressed until fracture, with the maximum force withstood by the material recorded as the fracture strength. The weights of the corresponding models are as follows- 30% - 40%  - 50%  - 60% - . In the event that one quarter of the origional model is still too strong, an eighth of the size is to be tested as well for the most dense infill. This experiment will be modelled in solidworks on a static setting with a constrained base and compressive top plate.
